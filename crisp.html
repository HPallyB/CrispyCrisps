        <h3>How were crisps invented?</h3>
        <p>Crisps are reported to be the result of a chef's rebellion. A diner 
            
        at Saratoga hotel in 1853 kept sending back his chips to the kitchen complaining that 
        they were not thin enough. Eventually the chef had enough. He cut wafer-think slices of potato, cooked them
        in oil until crisp, and sent them out to his fussy customer to teach him a lesson. But the joke 
        backfired because the diners loved them.Crisps first came to Britain from frances in the early part of 20th century. </p>
